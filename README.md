Additionally, it extends Typedoc with additional options for a richer user experience.

to view this theme.

## Theme

Build the theme by running `yarn build:theme`.

After you install the module, you can use this theme in a build by running:

`typedoc --theme ./node_modules/typedoc-neo-theme/bin/default`

## Plugin

Build the plugin by running `yarn build:plugin`.

After you install the module, you can use this plugin in a build by running:

`typedoc --theme ./node_modules/typedoc-neo-theme/bin/default --plugin typedoc-neo-theme`

Alternatively it can be partially placed in the typedoc options:

`typedoc --options typedoc.json --theme node_modules/typedoc-neo-theme/bin/default`

### Typedoc options
This plugin adds additional options that can be placed in your `typedoc.json` file.

#### Links
You may want to specify additional links to appear in your header that don't point to
reference documentation but related documentation for your platform.

```json
"links": [{
    "label": "Guides",
    "url": "https://developers.google.com/actions/extending-the-assistant"
  }, {
    "label": "Reference",
    "url": "https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/nodejsv2/overview"
  }]
```

#### Outline
The left-hand side is a global navigation. This can be auto-generated by the Typedoc engine and
theme, or it can be manually specified by including an object in your options. You provide a custom
navigation with links that point to `modules/{object value}.html`.

```json
"outline": [{
    "Actions SDK": {
      "Overview": "actionssdk",
      "api/v2": "actionssdk_api_v2"
    },
    "Dialogflow": {
      "Overview": "dialogflow",
      "api/v1": "dialogflow_api_v1",
      "api/v2": "dialogflow_api_v2"
    }
  }]
```

#### Search
Not all of the files in the reference documentation may be useful for developers. You can select
certain pages to be high priority. These will retain the icon, along with displaying a subtitle and
a kind (like `class` or `interface`). Items not included will be deprioritized, with smaller text.

```json
"search": [{
    "name": "dialogflow.DialogflowConversation.data",
    "subtitle": "Persistent data"
  }, {
    "name": "conversation/response.BasicCard",
    "subtitle": "Rich response"
  }, {
    "name": "conversation/response.BasicCardOptions",
    "subtitle": "Rich response"
  }]
```

### Link to source
You can set up links to your source code under each property in the documentation.

```json
"source": [{
  "path": "https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs/blob/master/src/",
  "line": "L"
}]
```

For a particular file and line, this can take you to a valid GitHub source for the
Actions on Google Node.js project.
